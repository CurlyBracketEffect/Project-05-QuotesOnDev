In this project I continued learning WP Core while I expanded on some previous learning about Ajax calls.

I got a lot more comfortable navigating WP files, and determining which ones were neccessary to modify to get the desired outcome.

I primarily used php with some Javascript and scss to style

The most difficult part of the project was figuring out how the WP REST API worked, and how to get it to return the correct data. Then it was all a matter of manipulating that data to suit the project parameters.
